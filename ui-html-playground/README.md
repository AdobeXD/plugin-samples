# UI HTML Playground

This plugin allows you to enter arbitrary HTML and preview the result within a dialog. You can also execute the last entered code in a dialog without any of the surrounding playground chrome.

## Usage

To edit some HTML in the playground, select **Plugins | UI HTML Playground | Edit...**. You'll be presented with some default HTML in an editor. You can then:

* Edit the HTML as needed (although you may prefer copying and pasting from another editor)
* Click the **Results** tab to see the rendered HTML
    * While in the **Results** tab, you can toggle **Dialog** to toggle the dialog simulation
* Click the **HTML** tab to go back to your code
* Click **Close** to close the dialog

If you want to see your code running in an actual dialog (instead of a simulated dialog), you can select **Plugins | UI HTML Playground | Run...**. Your last entered code will be run within the context of a dialog.

> Note: None of the dialog buttons will work; you'll need to press **ESC** to exit your customized dialog.
