# Elements

Elements (or elements) are fundamental to your user interface.

* [Buttons](./elements/buttons.md) are used to invoke actions or dismiss dialogs. Buttons come in many different semantic styles, so it's easy to use the right button for the right occasion.
* [Checkboxes](./elements/checkboxes.md) provide the user with the ability to mark certain interface elements as selected.
* [Dropdowns](./elements/dropdowns.md) allow the user to select a single item from a list of items.
* [Links](./elements/links.md) will open the user's default web browser with the specified web address.
* [Rules](./elements/rules.md) are used to visually segment your user interface.
* [Sliders](./elements/sliders.md) allow the user to pick a value from a finite range of values.
* [Text fields](./elements/textfields.md) enable the user to enter custom data.
* [Tooltips](./elements/tooltips.md) are used to assist the user when an element's purpose may not be obvious.
