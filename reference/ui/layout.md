# Supported Layout

The XD user interface APIs support three layout modes:

* [Block layout](./layout/block.md) is the default layout mode. Each element is given the entire width of its container, and elements in sequence are stacked vertically &mdash; like blocks!
* [Flexbox layout](./layout/flex.md) is the most flexible layout mode. Elements can be positioned within containers using a wide variety of rules, including rules that specify how elements can grow and shrink, and how elements should be aligned with respect to each other.
* [Relative and absolute positioning](./layout/positioning.md) provides the most pixel-perfect control over where elements are positioned. When the other modes don't suffice, you can use relative and absolute positioning, but you'll be in full control over where the element is positioned (for better or worse).
