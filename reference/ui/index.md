# User Interface Components 

While plenty of XD plugins are perfectly suited to run like headless scripts, many plugin creators will want to offer the user a way to interact. XD plugins can display UI in the form of modal dialogs, built with JavaScript and a supported subset of HTML and CSS.

The tutorials contained in this section will give you an in-depth look at UI features available to your plugin through the API.


## Insertion Points

An **insertion point** is an area within XD that can accept custom user interface. The following insertion points are available:

* [Modal Dialogs](./dialogs/index.md)
