# window.localStorage
Provides a local key-value store useful for setting preferences and other kinds of data.
This data is technically persistent, but can be cleared in a variety of ways, so you should not
store data using `localStorage` that you cannot otherwise reconstruct.

Do not store passwords or other secure forms of data using `localStorage`. Instead, use [secureStorage](./secureStorage.md).
