# Designing a plugin experience

These guidelines will help you define the best user experience for your plugin. Based on your users workflow and the plugin action, different UX and UI patterns should be considered as you create a plugin.

Plugins can interact with the user at different levels, for example, some plugins will have quick actions which in some use cases won’t render UI, and some will include multiple actions that need UI.
