# Text Styles

This sample has two commands that create text nodes with styled text.

## Usage

1. Run "Plugins > Add Red Text". You should see a new text node with red text.
1. Run "Plugins > Add Rainbow Text". You should see a new text node with the classical colors of the rainbow, and each word appropriately styled (so the word "yellow" is filled with yellow).
