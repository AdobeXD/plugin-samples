# Simple Drag and Drop Plugin

This plugin demonstrates how to build a simple panel that supports dragging images and dropping them on the XD canvas.

## Use

* Install this plugin in your XD environment
* Select "Image URL" or "Local File" from the action dropdown.
  * If you select "Local File", you can select a local file from your computer by clicking "Load Image"
  * If you select "Image URL", you can paste a URL or a base64-encoded DATA URI and then click "Download"
* Once you select a file or download an image, it'll be added to the "Images to Drag" section.
* At this point you can drag from the "Images to Drag" section on to the XD canvas to add all the images in that section.
