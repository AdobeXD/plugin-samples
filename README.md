# An overview of building Adobe XD plugins

Adobe XD plugins extend the capabilities of XD by adding new features to the app, automating workflows, connecting the app to external services, and more.

On this page, we'll give you a quick overview of what you can create and what skills you need to bring. From there, you can choose your own adventure: build a "Hello, World" plugin in our Quick Start guide, browse our tutorials, view standalone sample code, or browse the API references.

Oh, and be sure to join the developer community while you're here! We want you to say hi (we'll say hi back).

Now, let’s supercharge the future of design together with XD plugins.


## What can you build?
The XD plugin APIs enable you to build plugins for a number of use cases, including:

- *Asset Management & Import*: Provide designers with access to stock photography and assets, and integrate with your DAM or brand management system.
- *Automation & Utility*: Help designers automate repetitive or tedious tasks. Unleash their creativity by enabling generative and data-driven designs.
- *Publish & Handoff*: Make publishing and handoff a breeze by integrating with online services and content management systems.
- *Designer & Stakeholder Collaboration*: Enhance collaboration between designers and stakeholders by integrating with the workflow services your team uses.

XD plugins appear to the user in one of two ways, as an "Plugins" menu item that:

1. Runs with no UI (like a script), or
2. Opens a custom modal UI where the user can interact with the plugin

You can learn more about the API surfaces available to you in our tutorials on Working with Content, Working with I/O, and Building User Interfaces, as well as in our API References.


## What skills do you need?

Below are the prerequisite skills you'll need to build a plugin. It's a short list! And even if you're new to coding, we think you'll be able to build your skills as you go.

### Required
*JavaScript*: XD plugins are written in JavaScript. The XD APIs support ES6+ JavaScript features, and ES5 is perfectly fine too. 

If you've never worked with JavaScript before, we recommend taking a moment to get familiar with the language first. But come back quickly; you don't need to be a JavaScript rock star to get started building XD plugins. The Quick Start guide and tutorials you find in the documentation should help you get going.

### Recommended
*HTML/CSS*: If you plan to offer a UI for your plugin, some familiarity with HTML and CSS is recommended. XD plugin APIs support a _subset_ of HTML and CSS for creating plugin UI.

### Optional
*React*: If you want to push your plugin UI even further, you can put your React skills to use.
